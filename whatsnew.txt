Shellnotes 4.0 Changelog
20/8/2023

Total Changes: 73

Additions:

- **SnE**: The new default text editor for the `newnote` & `readnote` commands. Written in python, it is lightweight and safe.
	-SnE (Shellnotes Notes Editor) and its requirements (requirements.txt) will be installed alongside shellnotes.
	-You can choose from a vast amount of tools to manipulate your notes, like notegrep.
	-It has built-in features like spell checking and text-to-speech.
	-You can applly different themes to match it to your liking.
	-You can paste your Notes on pastebin or on Github as Gists (you'll need a Github API Token, which you can set using `shellnotes -ght`).
	-SnE uses the loguru module to save logfiles that contain information your sessions, which you can view with `shellnotes -l`.
You can always change the default editor using `shellnotes -sd`.

-New listnotes option: You can now view each and every one of your notes in your Notes folder via the `listnotes --view` or `listnotes -v` command. It basically runs `less` inside of your Notes folder.

- `rmdups`: A new command that uses `awk` to safely remove duplicate lines in a note. Use with caution.

- `clipnote`: You are now able to paste the contents of your clipboard to a new note instantly, or, by using `-r`/`--reverse` as a parameter, take the text from the note and copy it to your clipboard. This new command takes advantage of the `xclip` package.

- Command autocompletion & file suggestions: `delnote`, `listnotes`, `newnote`, `notegrep`, `notewc`, `quickread`, `readnote` and `renamenote` can now suggest the user possible options (arguments) and/or list the user's notes when the `<Tab>` key is pressed after the command is typed.

Fixes:

- Logfiles are no longer duplicated inside `util/`

Updates & Changes:

- Optimized hidden commands
- Updated documentation (fixed grammar and spelling mistakes, removed unnecessary details, add new info for SnE)
- Updated install.sh and uninstall.sh to support SnE & new commands.

Welcome to shellnotes 4.0!

It's been a while.
I haven't had the time to work on this project, since many personal issues and responsibilities use most of my time. After almost three years, however, we're back with another update. Shellnotes 4 introduces new tools and commands such as `clipnote`, `rmdups` and `SnE`; a new GUI text editor for your notes. It also enhances the user's experience with command autocompletion and file suggestions for most commands. Try experimenting with it!
I feel like this project is getting bigger than it should. All the main features of shellnotes have been covered quite a long time ago, however I always try and add as many new stuff as possible. I learn a lot of new things in the process but, after all, the project ends up being overcomplicated and hard to maintain. Few people use it anyway.
If I have enough time in the next months I will try and rewrite the main parts of shellnotes and optimize the program as much as possible, as it looks really messy and non-professional. I don't really think there's much more to add to it and I think I should move on.
In any case, I'll try and have as much fun as possible.

Have fun taking notes!
