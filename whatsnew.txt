Shellnotes 3.5 Updates
6/7/2021

Additions:

- `notegrep`: new command for manipulating notes with grep's tools
- Added parameters and improved `quickread`
- Added the set-defaults.sh log as an option in the logfile viewer (`shellnotes -l`).
- `shellnotes -i` or `--info`: Information about your shellnotes copy
- Added manpages for hidden commands (`clearlogs`, `resetshellnotes`)
- `resetshellnotes -f` or `--force`: Avoid prompt when resetting shellnotes.

Fixes:

- Fixed clearlogs.sh generating empty logfiles inside `/exec`
- Fixed bug #116 `-DynamicOutputBug`: "listnotes -d output generates autoscroll, instead of starting from where the command was executed."
- Fixed "\n" input resulting in an error
- Fixed auto-update illegal math bug
- Fixed not returning to previous directory bug
- Fixed bug #72 `-WithoutStringBug`: "If there are no matches in the input, "notegrep -ws" will display the file as is."

Updates & Changes:

- Reorganized scripts under `util/`
- Optimized the install script (`install.sh`)
- Enhanced all manpages
- New logging method: Logging directly from executables, in order for the process to take less time (clears logfiles with same method)
- Updated Documentation
- Reorganized the logfile system
- Removed syntax files (stored in `util/.syntax/`)
- Changed `listnotes` output: It's more traditional now
- Renamed `noteinfo` to `notewc` as it uses the `wc` command & changed its output
- `resetshellnotes` now resets the user's shell

Welcome to shellnotes 3.5!

This version brings many bug fixes as well as additions for shellnotes! 
Starting with the main feature of the update, `notegrep` is a tool that can be used on a daily basis. It simply uses grep to change the way you read your notes. You can experiment this new tool as well as a variety of options (split-character, without-character, multiple patterns and files and more).
The biggest improvement of 3.5 must be `quickread`. There are some new parameters you can play with, or you can just test its new error-handling ability.
Let's not forget the bug fixes: It's even safer to use shellnotes without worrying about errors occuring.
And last, shellnotes is now way faster than before. Instead of compiling loggers on the go, shellnotes uses pre-existing executables to speed up the process.

Still don't know what's going on? Read the manpages! By the way, the manpages got updated as well...

Have fun taking notes!
