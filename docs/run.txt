How to run the files
====================

Files inside .shellnotes/ are the ones you can run.
The files inside the subfolders (util, def, logs, ver) must not be run.
After the installation, the folder .shellnotes is created in the home (~) folder.
The .shellnotes folder contains all the source code needed for the program to work properly.

So, the files to run are:
	-bash_update.sh
	-update.sh
	-install.sh
	-uninstall.sh
	-set_defaults.sh
	-.shellnotes.sh

And can be run by:
	-bash ~/.shellnotes/bash_update.sh
	-sh ~/.shellnotes/update.sh
	-sh ~/.shellnotes/install.sh
	-sh ~/.shellnotes/uninstall.sh
	-sh ~/.shellnotes/set_defaults.sh
	-sh ~/.shellnotes/.shellnotes.sh

Should be run when:
	-Updating shellnotes from bash shell
	-Updating shellnotes from other shells
	-(re)Installing shellnotes
	-Uninstalling, disabling or enabling shellnotes
	-Setting default note editors and folder for writing and storing notes
	-Running the main script, which is always run after the installation

A better way of running the above files is by running the commands from the main script (.shellnotes.sh):
	-$ shellnotes -u (and the default shell is bash)
	-$ shellnotes -u
	-no command line argument for install.sh-
	-no command line argument for uninstall.sh-
	-$ shellnotes -sd
	-.shellnotes.sh is already running in the background-
