About Updating
==============

How to update:
	- For bash users, there is a unique update file called bash_update.sh. Run it with:
	bash ~/.shellnotes/bash_update.sh.
	- For other shell users, there is a file called update.sh in ~/.shellnotes/. The user can run this script by typing sh ~/.shellnotes/update.sh
	- Or just type "shellnotes --update" in your terminal and shellnotes will find your shell and
	redirect you to the correct update script.

About updating:
	-The update file searches for a new release in the official shellnotes repository. If there is a newer one, it updates shellnotes.
	-Try running "shellnotes -u" every 10-13 days, as it is the ideal time for a new version to come out, based on github's stats.
