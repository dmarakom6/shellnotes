listnotes
=========

The listnotes command was introduced in shellnotes 1.2x and uses the command ls (man ls) to locate your notes from whenever you are.
Other than 'listnotes', you can use parameters as well. For example:
-listnotes -d or --dynamic for a dynamic view of all your notes and their content
-listnotes -n or --number to see how many notes you have.

If listnotes doesn't show your note, try 'findmisplacednote' to track it.
If listnotes doesn't recognize your notes folder, try running the shellnotes configuration tool (shellnotes -sd)
