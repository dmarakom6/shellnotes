auto-update
===========

In shellnotes 3.0 and later, there's an auto-update feature.
After the installation, every time you open your terminal, shellnotes will search for new updates automatically. This might help users that don't want to run "shellnotes -u" every time a new version
is released.

However, this feature might make your terminal slower and heavier. This means that every time you
open a terminal, you might have to wait 1-2 seconds before the command line interface appears, in
order for auto-update to search for new updates. For this reason, this feature is disabled by 
default.

To enable or disable this feature, type "shellnotes -au" or "shellnotes --auto-update" in your
terminal and toggle auto-update.
