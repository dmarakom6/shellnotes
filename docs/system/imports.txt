shellnotes imports rule
=======================

The main script for running shellnotes is .shellnotes.sh found in ~/.shellnotes/.shellnotes.sh after 
the installation. This file contains the user's default shell, found during the installation 
proccess, as well as all the imports needed for the program to work. The imports consist of:

	1. Commands (most of the files found in /util)
	2. Scripts run every time the terminal is launched (i.e. Version getter (getv))
	3. The shellnotes command with all of its parameters (file found in /util/shellnotes.sh, params 
	in subfolders of util/)
	4. "Hidden" commands (files containing a (.) in /util, actions for cleaning space etc.)

In the .shellnotes.sh file, the imports are ordered like this:

	#user's shell

	#Warnings
	#Warnings


	scripts run every time the terminal is launched

	utility scripts (commands) found in ~/.shellnotes/util/


	. ~/.shellnotes/util/shellnotes.sh -> The shellnotes command, which imports all its parameters


	Hidden commands (i.e. clearlogs, run only when necessary)
