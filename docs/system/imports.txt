shellnotes imports rule
=======================

The main script for running shellnotes is .shellnotes.sh found in ~/.shellnotes/.shellnotes.sh after 
the installation. This file contains the user's default shell's shebang, found during the installation 
proccess, as well as all the imports needed for the program to work. These are:

	1. Commands (most of the files found in /util)
	2. Scripts run every time the terminal is launched (i.e. Version retriever (getv))
	3. "Hidden" commands (files containing a (.) in /util, actions for clearing space etc.)

In the .shellnotes.sh file, the imports are ordered like this:

	#!user's shell

	#Warnings
	#Warnings


	->scripts run every time the terminal is launched

	->utility scripts (commands) found in ~/.shellnotes/util/


	-> . ~/.shellnotes/util/shellnotes.sh -> The shellnotes command
