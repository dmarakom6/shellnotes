shellnotes manpages
===================

Just like most linux programs, shellnotes has its own manpages, which can be viewed by running
"man <command>" in the terminal. Upon installation, shellnotes moves its manpages from docs/manpages/ to the default man page path, in other words, the path where "man" searches for manpages.

All commands have manual entries and you can view them with man (i.e. man newnote).
You can also do "man shellnotes".
