reset shellnotes
================

"resetshellnotes" is a hidden command, that erases all the memory from the program.
This includes:
-Default files and folder, sets them to gedit, nano, "~/Notes", which are the defaults after installation
-User data
-Logfiles
-Source files used for several functions
-Built-in libraries used for the above functions

Your Notes folder will change to ~/Notes, but your notes WILL NOT be removed.
They will be safely transfered there.

This command is made mostly for the program's testers. After testing a new release,
They must clear their data from the program's source files, in order to push them to the 
repository.

This command should be used ONLY WHEN NECESSARY, just like all other hidden commands.
If your notes have disappeared, or you cant find the displayed note folder, use this command to
reset everything to its normal state.
