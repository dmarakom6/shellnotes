hidden commands
===============

Shellnotes have hidden commands as well. Their scripts are hidden files and can be found in .shellnotes/util/.hidden/.

They are hidden mainly because shellnotes does not want the user to use them on a daily basis. They change valuable information like configuration and logs. The user can always refer to these commands, but only when necessary. 
Otherwise, it is not recommended to use them.
