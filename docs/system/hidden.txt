hidden commands
===============

Most shellnotes' commands are known, and shown in commands.txt, but some scripts contain hidden 
commands as well. These scripts are hidden files and can be found in .shellnotes/util/.hidden/.

They are hidden mainly because shellnotes does not want the user to use them on a daily basis. This 
is because they stop or start extra processes, clear logfiles, or change valuable information and 
data in the source path. The user can always refer to these commands, but only when necessary. 
Otherwise, it is not recommended to use them.
