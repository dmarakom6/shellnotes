syntax files
============

Syntax files can be found in .shellnotes/util/syntax/. These files just simple shell scripts that 
contain commented-out code, that is used in most utilities. They are used only by the 
developers,in case they want to refer to some old code that they had re-used in the past. Don't 
mind them.
